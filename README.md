# Life Archive

**Life Archive** is a privacy-first desktop application that helps people capture, preserve, and revisit their life through time.

It is not just a note-taking app.  
It is a **personal digital memory**, built around **time**, not folders.

## ✨ What is Life Archive?

Life Archive allows users to:
- write daily text notes
- attach photos to moments
- view their life as a chronological timeline
- keep everything **local and private**

The goal is simple:
> Help people remember what their life actually looked like — and understand it later.

## 🎯 Core Idea

Most people:
- write notes in different apps
- store photos separately
- forget context over time

Life Archive unifies everything into a **single timeline**, where:
- notes
- photos
- moments  

are connected by **time**, not structure.

## 🧩 MVP Scope (Current Focus)

### Included
- Text notes
- Photo attachments
- Timeline view (day → month)
- Local storage (SQLite + filesystem)
- Fast, minimal UI

### Not included (yet)
- Cloud sync
- AI analysis
- Chat assistant
- Audio / video
- Mobile version

This deliberate limitation allows us to build a **solid foundation** first.

It is built for people who want a calm, reliable space for reflection.
